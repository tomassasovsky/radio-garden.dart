A Dart app that uses the [Radio Garden API][radio_garden_api] to play radio stations from around the world in your Discord server.

---

## Getting Started ðŸš€

### Getting environment variables


```sh
bash get_environments.sh
```

### Running the server on Docker

```sh
bash relaunch_prod.sh #Or relaunch.sh if working in dev
```

### Running the server on a Dev Container âš¡

By running the server in a dev container you'll be able to use zsh and you'll not need to wait for docker to rebuild every time you want to test a change in the code.


- Install Dev Containers in VS Code.
- Press F1 and run `Rebuild and Reopen in container`.

From there you can run:

```dart
dart bin/radio_garden_development.dart
```


## Running Tests with coverage ðŸ§ª

To run all unit tests use the following command:

```sh
$ dart pub global activate coverage 1.2.0
$ dart test --coverage=coverage
$ dart pub global run coverage:format_coverage --lcov --in=coverage --out=coverage/lcov.info
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov)
.

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
$ genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
$ open coverage/index.html
```
